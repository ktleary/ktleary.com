      I'm a software developer focused on Javascript, with over 15 years of
      experience working on the net. Much of this time has been spent working
      with small companies serving large clients in the financial, healthcare
      and e-commerce spaces. I am also a web-standards and open-source
      enthusiast and am a member of the{" "}

      On the front-end, I am currently writing in React and have lead projects
      in Angular, as well as enterprise upgrades from legacy codebases. On the
      back-end, I typically use Node.js and Python.

      My roots are in writing Javascript and database applications in the good
      old days when I helped build a successful e-learning company, DigitalMed.
      I am a graduate of Skidmore College and a native of Greater Boston, though
      I am now based out of New York City and my work has brought me far and
      wide recently.
